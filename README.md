## Introduction

Welcome to the U.S.A. Gun Violence Data Analysis project! This project explores and analyzes gun violence data in the United States from January 2013 to March 2018.
## Features:
- **Temporal Patterns:** The analysis revealed intriguing temporal patterns, uncovering the dynamics of incidents over the years.

- **Demographic Trends:** Understanding the demographics of victims and subjects/suspects provided insights into the human aspect of gun violence.

- **Database Schema:** The primary dataset, 'Gun_violence_data.xlsx,' is transformed into two structured tables: `incident` and `participant`.
  
- **SQL Queries:** A collection of SQL queries is available to facilitate exploration and extraction of meaningful patterns and insights from the dataset.

- **Geospatial Analysis:** Leveraging latitude and longitude data, the project offers geospatial insights into the distribution of gun violence incidents across the United States.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:

MySQL for data processing and querying.

Excel for initial data exploration and cleaning.

## Dataset / Database Schema

## Insights

Key insights derived from the analysis, including trends, patterns, and correlations in U.S.A. gun violence incidents.
1. Count incidents per year

2. Count incidents per year and month:

3. The average number of participants in incidents:

4. The average number of killed and injured per incident:

5. The count of incidents per year and average values for various attributes, by joining the both tables:

6. I Calculate the total number of incidents in each congressional district:

7. The count of distinct incidents by state and the count of distinct location types for each state 
    
8. Top states and cities with the highest number of incidents, Join both state and city level data. 

9. Top states and cities with the highest number of incidents with the use of left join

10. Top 5 cities or counties with the highest number of gun violence incidents.

11. Find incidents with a high number of stolen guns involved:

12. Find the Incidents by Month, Age Group, Relationship Type:

13. Find the Highest Incidents by Month, Age Group, Relationship Type:

14. Find incidents with the highest number of victims by age group:

15. Identify incidents with a high number of participants and a high number of killed:

16. Calculate the percentage of incidents involving family relationships:

17. The count of unique incidents, categorized by participant relationships, and the corresponding percentage distribution among those relationships:
    
18. Incidents by Gun Type and Total Guns Involved:

19. I retrieve incident details (incident_id, date, state, city_or_county) where latitude is between 19.1127 and 71.3368, and longitude is between -165.5860 and -67.2711

## Getting Started
